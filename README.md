7 days and 80 hours of development, Night Tremors is my first excursion into building an experience with Godot and my submission for Scream Jam 2023. Fight your way through, and escape the nightmare you've stumbled into. Be careful though, these beasts you'll find along the way aren't as dead as they seem.


The game itself is short and sweet, expect no more than 20 minutes of gameplay, but it was a great way to build a foundation for a future project and I will be expanding on this in the future in some form or another.
